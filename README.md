# Sleeping Gods - Distant Skies
Markdown files to support the board game Sleeping Gods - Distant Skies using Obsidian

The game throws quests and keywords at which can be very tiresome to track. It drew my wife crazy so I added all locations and keywords to my Obsidian vault and use dataview to display locations and keyword discovered. Everything is managed via the metadata properties 


## Locations
For each location you can tick out whether its visited, crossed out, and what location actions have been done. Each location also has a list of keywords relevant for that location and on which atlas page it can be found.
